      <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="maincontent" -->
      <p>9th of May, 2009, squashed firmly between the bank holiday  weekend and the FA Cup, the Sausage Sizzle makes its appearance once again at  1st Letty Green Scout Hut. This annual fund raiser is the main support for the  group over the coming year and last time we managed to raise more than &pound;800 to  go towards tents and camping equipment for all the kids and leaders alike. This  looked like a tough target to beat and with fingers tightly crossed, everyone  prayed for clear bright sunshine to encourage kids and adults of all ages, from  near and far to join us in not only celebrating the thriving existence of the  group, but also for a fun afternoon! Our wishes were answered and come 3pm the  weather was perfect. For those of you who have never been to the Sausage Sizzle  before, imagine a countryside fun fair, only concentrated down into a small  space surrounding the Scout Hut on Pipers    Lane. <br />
        Even from a distance you could hear the blaring, yet  appropriate DJ, playing everything from &ldquo;The Gorillaz&rdquo; to &ldquo;Take That&rdquo;, and this  definitely was &ldquo;The Greatest Day&rdquo; of our scouting year so far&hellip; Walking along  the road towards the sound, the mouth-watering scent of hotdogs and onions  drifts along the faint breeze and you realise how the event received its name.  When you eventually make it to the Fayre, following ear and nose alike, there  is always a sense of satisfaction, at least for us regulars that the Scouting  creed is still popular as the grounds are literally bursting at the seams with  people queuing anxiously for the already dwindling supply of hotdogs, or  waiting excitedly to &ldquo;Beat The Goalie&rdquo; or thrown mop heads at multi-coloured  cans or any of the other great games to play at the Sausage Sizzle. The event  only lasts 2 hours from 3-5pm, so there is a lot to pack into your time. From  Tombolas to Raffles, Jacobs Ladder to Pet The Bunnies, there is something for  everyone, but my favourite (and the one I&rsquo;m always helping on!) is the  &ldquo;Crockery Smash!&rdquo; Pretty much self-explanatory, people queue, and yes they  queue happily for this, to pay 50p for 8 wooden, tennis ball-sized balls which  they can throw, as hard as they can at rows of plates, cups, mugs and bowls so  that they explode in a satisfying tinkle of ruined pottery. The ultimate cure  for stress if ever there was one. It is, of course one of the highest earners  of the day and just as enjoyable as beating the scouts at the football. Letty  Green Scouts are fast acquiring a good name for their footballing achievements,  but anyone is welcome to try and &ldquo;Beat The Goalie&rdquo; on penalties. 20p for three  shots, and if you score all three, your trophy is being one of the lucky few to  choose a sweet from the precious treasury of Maoams or Gummy Bears. If you&rsquo;re  exhausted by all the excitement, or just need a break before you go out and  challenge the goalkeeper again, there is plenty of space to sit and relax in  the shade inside the hut, with tea, coffee or squash to help cool off.<br />
        All too quickly its 5 o&rsquo;clock and the winners of the Raffle,  Jacobs Ladder and the new Masks competition are read out (none of which I have  ever won in the many, many years I&rsquo;ve been to this event!) and it is time to go  home. For another year everyone is thoroughly sausaged and sizzled out and  after everything is packed away, its timed to count the days takings. With baited  breathe, we all wait for the treasurer&rsquo;s email, confirming the success of the  day&rsquo;s adventure. And sure enough, once again we have topped the top, with a  whopping &pound;906.61 made after all costs or expenditures.<br />
        Satisfied at a job well done, I would like to thank everyone  who contributed to the day, especially Peter Kirk and his wife for cooking the  amazing hotdogs and Charlie at CJ&rsquo;s Disco for the great backing tracks. I would  also like to thank Sarah Sullivan, Andy Chapman, Ken Hood, Mike Crafer and the  scouts who helped set up the day before. Nikki , Glynis &amp; Clive and anyone  else behind the scenes, or on the stalls who helped make the day go smoothly.  Until next year, hope to see everyone there again, and anyone new as well!</p>
