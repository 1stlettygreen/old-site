      <p>''It is with much regret and  after a lot of thought that as from the 1st July 2010 the Scout Troop at 1st  Letty Green will temporarily close.</p>
      <p>This is due to insufficient  leaders available currently to run the troop successfully and a downturn in  troop membership due mainly to the chosen evening being unsuitable for most  children.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The Beaver Colony and Cub  Pack are Unaffected by this closure and will continue on their  Thursday night slots.</p>
      <p>For further details or  questions please contact the GSL on the email address above...</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center"><strong>Friday  12th December saw the launch of the new 1st Letty Green  Scout Troop. </strong></p>
      <p>The  original Troop closed approximately 5 years ago after numbers dwindled and  leaders departed. </p>
      <p>However  with a large number of the Cub Pack reaching Scout age and both of us (the  former Cub leaders) also agreeing to move up, a Scout Troop is once again up  and running, making it the first new Troop in the Hertfordshire centenary year. </p>
      <p><img src="images/scout/Group, district &amp; countyfw.jpg" alt="The Group, district &amp; County" width="200" height="142" class="imgleft" />The  party to celebrate the launch, which proved to be an excellent evening, enjoyed  a good turnout with plenty of support from both County and District as well as  parents and group members. We were delighted that the County Commissioner,  Ivor Thomas, and Assistant County Commission, Dave Pullen, also found time to  come along.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><img src="images/scout/Panther Patrolfw.jpg" alt="Panther Patrol" width="200" height="133" class="imgright" />The  evening got off to a good start with the welcoming speeches being followed by  Trevor Salter investing nine former Cubs into the newly formed Troop. Once the  Investitures were completed, and all the badges, new group scarves, record  books and investiture certificates issued, the evening&rsquo;s activity got underway. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><img src="images/scout/CobraPatrolfw.jpg" alt="Cobra Patrol" width="200" height="165" class="imgleft" />The  activity involved protecting an egg using straws, paper, balloons thread and a  small billy, to see whether it could survive a drop from a height of 10  ft.&nbsp; Teams were made up of the two new  patrols together with the other children present.&nbsp; There was also a team made up of parents and  group members, a team made up of County and District officials and, of course,  we, as leaders, also took part.<br />
        &nbsp;<br />
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Most  of the eggs survived the initial drop (as we had supplied too much paper) but  when they were checked after being unwrapped they all broke! Well all except  our leaders&rsquo; one as it was hard boiled (why have a billy and not use it and we  had to win didn&rsquo;t we!)</p>
      <p><img src="images/scout/The Patrolsfw.jpg" alt="The Patrols" width="200" height="152" class="imgright" />Beckii  Hood was also invested as an Explorer by Dave Simpson and she is looking  forward to her time in Scouting. Having previously been a member of both the  Brownies and Guides, and gaining her Young Leaders trefoil, her experience  will, without doubt, be an asset to the Group.</p>
      <p>After  the mess was cleared away a buffet was served (well more like taken by the  kids) and mulled wine enjoyed by the adults. General chit chat and getting to  know everyone continued until the evening came to an end around 9pm.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>As  leaders we would like to take this opportunity to thank all who attended the  launch and helped with the running of the event.<br />
        The  first meeting of the Troop is on 9th January 2009 and we are already  in the process of organising a full program for next year. We are also planning  a family camp for the whole group over the Whitsun weekend as well as taking  the Scouts to PAW and the Herts 100 Camps, This will be followed closely by our  annual Summer Camp.&nbsp; With outings to Roller City,  swimming, go karting and Duxford also being planned, it all looks to be a busy  year!</p>
